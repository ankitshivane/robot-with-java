Here’s a sample `README.md` file for your Robot Framework project using IntelliJ IDEA with Maven and Java:

# Robot Framework Project with IntelliJ IDEA

This project demonstrates how to set up and run Robot Framework tests integrated with a Java project using IntelliJ IDEA. The project includes example tests and follows a structured folder setup for scalability and maintenance.

## Prerequisites

1. **Install IntelliJ IDEA**:
   - Download and install the Community or Ultimate edition from [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

2. **Install Plugins**:
   - Open IntelliJ IDEA.
   - Navigate to `File > Settings > Plugins`.
   - Install the following plugins:
     - **Robot Framework Support** (for `.robot` files).
     - **Maven or Gradle Plugin** (built-in by default) to manage Java dependencies.

3. **Install Python**:
   - Robot Framework is based on Python, so you'll need to install Python and Robot Framework.

### Steps to Install Python:
   - Download and install Python 3.x from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - After installation, open a terminal and run:
     ```bash
     pip install robotframework
     ```

4. **Install Selenium Library (Optional for Web Testing)**:
   - If you're using Selenium for web testing, install the Selenium library:
     ```bash
     pip install robotframework-seleniumlibrary
     ```

## Project Structure

```
root/
│
├── pom.xml                    # Maven POM file
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   └── java/              # Java source files (if any)
│   └── test/
│       ├── robot/
│       │   ├── sample_test.robot  # Sample Robot test file
│       │   └── resources/     # Any resources (e.g., keywords, variables)
```

```

## How to Run the Tests

1. **Navigate to the Test Directory**:
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

2. **Run the Sample Test**:
   Use the `robot` command to run your `.robot` test file. Make sure to replace the path and file name if necessary.

   Example:
   ```bash
   robot .\src\test\robot\sample_test.robot
   ```

   This command will execute the `sample_test.robot` file.

## Adding New Tests

To add new test cases, create `.robot` files under the `src/test/robot/` directory. You can also organize your tests into subfolders based on the functionality they cover.

Example test case:
```robot
*** Settings ***
Library    SeleniumLibrary

*** Test Cases ***
User Should Be Able To Login
    Open Browser    https://example.com/login    chrome
    Input Text    //input[@name='username']    my_username
    Input Text    //input[@name='password']    my_password
    Click Button    //button[@type='submit']
    [Teardown]    Close Browser
```
